-- What is SQL? Itâ€™s a language for querying relational databases.

07:38 Introduction to SQL

-- List all tables in the current database (PostgreSQL example)
SELECT table_name
FROM information_schema.tables
WHERE table_schema = 'public';

22:33 Setup Your Environment

# Install SQLite (example)
sudo apt-get install sqlite3
sqlite3 mydb.db

34:01 Query Data (SELECT)

SELECT first_name, last_name
FROM employees
WHERE department = 'Sales';

01:32:31 DDL Commands

CREATE TABLE customers (
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  name VARCHAR(100),
  email VARCHAR(100) UNIQUE
);
ALTER TABLE customers ADD COLUMN signup_date DATE;
DROP TABLE old_customers;

01:43:44 DML Commands

INSERT INTO customers (name, email, signup_date)
VALUES ('Alice', 'alice@example.com', '2025-08-06');
UPDATE customers
SET email = 'alice@newdomain.com'
WHERE id = 1;
DELETE FROM customers
WHERE signup_date < '2020-01-01';

ðŸŸ¡ Intermediate Level
02:08:03 Filtering Data

SELECT * FROM orders
WHERE amount BETWEEN 100 AND 500
  AND status IN ('shipped', 'delivered');

02:47:57 SQL Joins (Basics)

SELECT o.id, c.name
FROM orders o
INNER JOIN customers c
  ON o.customer_id = c.id;

03:27:29 SQL Joins (Advanced)

SELECT c.name, COUNT(o.id) AS order_count
FROM customers c
LEFT JOIN orders o
  ON o.customer_id = c.id AND o.status = 'completed'
RIGHT JOIN regions r
  ON c.region_id = r.id
FULL OUTER JOIN returns rt
  ON rt.order_id = o.id;

04:02:09 Set Operators

SELECT email FROM newsletter_subscribers
UNION
SELECT email FROM promo_subscribers;

04:47:41 SQL Functions

SELECT CURRENT_DATE, SESSION_USER, VERSION();

04:52:58 String Functions

SELECT UPPER(name), SUBSTR(email, 1, POSITION('@' IN email)-1)
FROM customers;

05:18:44 Numeric Functions

SELECT ROUND(price, 2), ABS(discount), FLOOR(quantity)
FROM products;

05:22:48 Date and Time Functions

SELECT NOW(), DATE_ADD(NOW(), INTERVAL 7 DAY), DATE_DIFF('day', order_date, NOW())
FROM orders;

06:59:06 NULL Functions

SELECT COALESCE(phone, 'N/A') AS phone_number
FROM customers;

08:07:50 Case Statement

SELECT order_id,
  CASE
    WHEN amount >= 1000 THEN 'High'
    WHEN amount >= 500 THEN 'Medium'
    ELSE 'Low'
  END AS priority
FROM orders;

08:43:36 Aggregate Functions

SELECT department, COUNT(*) AS cnt, AVG(salary), MAX(hire_date)
FROM employees
GROUP BY department;

08:50:11 Window Functions Basics

SELECT id, amount,
  ROW_NUMBER() OVER (ORDER BY amount DESC) AS rn
FROM orders;

09:47:00 Window Aggregate

SELECT id, amount,
  SUM(amount) OVER (PARTITION BY customer_id) AS total_per_customer
FROM orders;

10:53:09 Window Ranking

SELECT id, amount,
  RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY region ORDER BY amount DESC) AS region_rank
FROM sales;

11:56:05 Window Value

SELECT date, revenue,
  LAG(revenue) OVER (ORDER BY date) AS prev_day,
  LEAD(revenue) OVER (ORDER BY date) AS next_day
FROM daily_revenue;

12:40:34 Advanced SQL Techniques

-- PIVOT example (SQL Server)
SELECT *
FROM sales
PIVOT (
  SUM(amount) FOR month IN ([Jan], [Feb], [Mar])
) AS pivot_table;

12:58:04 Subqueries

SELECT name
FROM customers
WHERE id IN (
  SELECT customer_id
  FROM orders
  WHERE amount > 1000
);

14:18:08 Common Table Expressions (CTE)

WITH recent_orders AS (
  SELECT * FROM orders
  WHERE order_date >= '2025-01-01'
)
SELECT customer_id, COUNT(*) 
FROM recent_orders
GROUP BY customer_id;

15:35:02 Views

CREATE VIEW high_value_customers AS
SELECT id, name
FROM customers
WHERE total_purchases > 5000;

16:36:40 CTAS and Temp Tables

-- CTAS
CREATE TABLE backup_orders AS
SELECT * FROM orders WHERE order_date < '2024-01-01';
-- Temp table (PostgreSQL)
CREATE TEMP TABLE tmp_top_customers AS
SELECT customer_id, SUM(amount) AS total
FROM orders
GROUP BY customer_id;

17:17:31 Compare Advanced Techniques

-- CTE vs subquery performance may vary; test both with EXPLAIN.

17:27:04 Stored Procedures

CREATE PROCEDURE AddProduct(name VARCHAR(100), price DECIMAL)
LANGUAGE SQL
AS $$
  INSERT INTO products (name, price) VALUES (name, price);
$$;

18:12:58 Triggers

CREATE TRIGGER update_timestamp
BEFORE UPDATE ON customers
FOR EACH ROW
EXECUTE PROCEDURE set_updated_timestamp();

18:23:42 Indexes

CREATE INDEX idx_orders_date ON orders(order_date);

20:20:31 Execution Plan

EXPLAIN ANALYZE
SELECT * FROM orders WHERE customer_id = 123;

21:11:03 Partitions

CREATE TABLE logs (
  id SERIAL,
  log_date DATE,
  message TEXT
) PARTITION BY RANGE (log_date);
CREATE TABLE logs_2025_08 PARTITION OF logs
  FOR VALUES FROM ('2025-08-01') TO ('2025-09-01');

21:43:39 30x Performance Tips

-- Example: use covering index
CREATE INDEX idx_covering ON orders(customer_id, order_date);

22:24:25 AI and SQL

-- Example: call a user-defined AI function to summarize text
SELECT ai_summarize(notes) FROM meeting_minutes;
